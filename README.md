## Hi there, I'm Charlie ðŸ‘‹

I'm Charlotte (but you can call me Charlie). I'm a designer and developer. My work spans across disciplines, including frontâ€‘end web development, concept art/illustration, 3D modeling, and data visualization. I was raised in [Santa Fe, New Mexico](http://sinclarius.com/sf/), and studied in Japan and Switzerland. My background is in architecture, communication design, and environmental research.

I help to solve complex problems through design. I currently work in the design/construction industry. Until recently, I collaborated with a team at RS21 on a combination of **information design**, **user experience research**, and **process/service optimization** projects.

In my spare time, I tinker with [creative coding](https://codepen.io/sinclarius/), [digital fabrication](https://www.behance.net/gallery/34916753/Waves-I-(2015)), and hand embroidery. I enjoy sketching, traveling, taking photos, and [contributing to OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/sinclarius).

### What I do
- **Information Design**
  Research-based strategy, design and development of websites, apps, maps, print materials, and more.

- **Architectural Design/Concept Art**
  Digital illustration and graphic design, including matte painting, 3D modeling, and architectural rendering.

- **Writing and Photography**
  Short-form and long-form writing, academic research, and copyediting experience with an emphasis on the intersection of digital and physical spacemaking.

### Skills
Visual communication and 2D/3D design, including: front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, d3, and Python), GIS/cartography, UX research/strategy, data viz, editorial/print design, 3D modeling, typography, and photography.

Most of my code belongs to my employers, but I have some snippets and experiments up on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@sinclarius), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/sinclarius/) and here on GitHub. Select work is available on [BÄ“hance](https://www.behance.net/sinclarius), with additional portfolio samples available upon request.

I post photos on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@sinclarius) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/boinkbonk/collections). I keep random thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sinclarius).
